# Contributing guidelines
Glad to see you here. There are many different ways in which you can contribute. One of them is simply trying the samples and providing us with your feedback. Or you can code some new features. We welcome all the contribution activity. Before you start, please read this short guide to save us some time and trouble.


## I have an idea for a new feature
Everybody loves new features! You can create a new issue or you can code it on your own and provide us with the pull request. Anyway don't forget to mention what's the use case and what's the expected output.


## I found a bug
Sorry to hear that. Create a new issue and label it as a bug. Before you send the issue, make sure that you include all the important information like

- Detailed description of the issue
- What was the version
- Screenshot (if possible)
- Error message
- What is an expected behavior

The more information you provide, the better. You can also fix the bug and submit a new pull request.


## Submitting pull request
We use [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). Fork this repository, create a new branch and start coding.

Before you send us new pull request, make sure that you meet following requirements

- Code is buildable
- All tests are green
- Code follows the .NET [Framework Design Guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx)
    - If you're not sure about some rule, follow the style of the existing code.


### Example - process of contribution
1. ```Tom``` forks this repository
2. Creates new branch for his ```cool``` feature
3. Hacks his code
4. Tests it!
5. Once he's happy with the code, he submits a pull request from his ```cool``` branch to this ```master``` branch
6. We discuss the pull request with ```Tom``` and maybe suggest some adjustments
7. Once the code is ready, we will merge it


### Learn how to write good commit messages
We hate sloppy commit messages. No more ```Performance tuning``` or ```Changed a few files```. Please read the following articles
